# Focus Timer ⏳  

This is a simple Pomodoro-style countdown timer built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  

## Features  
- Default 25-minute timer  
- Start, Stop, and Reset buttons

- Clean and responsive design  

## Purpose  
I am a beginner learning web development. I built this project to practice:  
- HTML structure  
- CSS styling  
- JavaScript functions, DOM manipulation, and events  

## How to Use  
1. Click **Start** to begin the countdown.  
2. Click **Stop** to pause the timer.  
3. Click **Reset** to set it back to 25 minutes.  

## Future Improvements

- Add sound notification  
- Make sessions count
